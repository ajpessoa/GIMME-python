This package is a prototype of a port of the GIMME algorithm, originally developed by [GatesLab](https://github.com/GatesLab) as an R package.

GIMME (Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation) is an algorithm for data-driven model searches in various individuals and collected across multiple points in time

## Requirements

To run the function the data must be in a single excell file. Each dataset (dataframe) must be in a separate worksheet.

## Installation

How to install the package will be here

## Usage

Here I'll explain how to use it (if I can figure it out...)
